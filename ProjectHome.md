# Fabrication #

Fabrication is a utility for the [PureMVC](http://www.puremvc.org) framework. It adds many useful features to typical PureMVC programming syntax that helps accelerate development. Fabrication is currently focussed on the Flex and Flash implementations of the PureMVC framework. Also Fabrication is built largely to support multi-modular application and uses only the multicore version of PureMVC.

Fabrication uses the [Pipes Utility](http://trac.puremvc.org/Utility_AS3_MultiCore_Pipes) of PureMVC to communicate between modules. However all the internals of pipes are abstracted out into a more intuitive Router principle.

Some of the important features of the Fabrication are listed below
  * Elimination of the application specific facade
  * Reflexive Mediator registration
  * Reflexive Notification handlers
  * Automatic multi-module piping and message routing
  * Support for different types of Undo/Redo

  1. [PureMVC Multicore](http://trac.puremvc.org/PureMVC_AS3_MultiCore).
